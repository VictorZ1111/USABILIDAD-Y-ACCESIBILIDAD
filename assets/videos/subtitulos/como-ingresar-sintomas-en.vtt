Tutorial: How to enter symptoms correctly.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.000
Step 1: Sign in to your account.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.000
Step 2: Go to the main panel.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.000
Step 3: Find the symptom form.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.000
Describe your symptoms clearly and specifically.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.000
Example: "severe headache for the past 2 days"

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.000
Include duration, intensity and location.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.000
Avoid being too brief or vague.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.000
Press the "Analyze" button when you're done.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.000
The system will give you a preliminary diagnosis.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.000
Remember: this does NOT replace a real medical consultation.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.000
Consult a professional if symptoms persist.
